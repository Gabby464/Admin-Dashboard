# Admin-Dashboard

### Introduction
Admin Dashboard is the second project for the FullStack JavaScript module on The Odin Project. This mock admin dashboard was built as a way to showcase the CSS grid knowledge that has been taught so far in this course. This is a simple HTML + CSS Layout for an Admin page that could be turned into a fully responsive product. The functionality planned is similar to an over-simplified Jira. The layout has been created using both Grid and Flexbox which makes it fully responsive to different computer screen-sizes. Mobile compatability is to be implemented.
