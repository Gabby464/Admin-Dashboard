# Admin-Dashboard

# Introduction
This is a simple HTML + CSS Layout for an Admin page that could be turned into a fully responsive product. The functionality planned is similar to an over-simplified Jira. The layout has been created using both Grid and Flexbox which makes it fully responsive to screen-sizes.
